CM1 version 1 release 5:  14 August 2003.

Summary of changes.


-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

- Vertically stretched grid spacing is now supported (stretch=1).
  Please read the README.stretch file for instructions.

- An option has been added to exclude artifical vertical diffusion
  when idiff=1.  The new switch is vdiff.  See README.namelist for
  more information.

- Added a new stat field:  stat_qmass.  When this option is chosen,
  the total mass of the individual water fields is included in the
  stats file.


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

- Changed the definition of saturation vapor pressure w.r.t. both liquid
  and ice to a more commonly used version.  It is also the same definition
  that is used in the Goddard ice microphysics code.

- Made a minor modification to the Kessler scheme to accomodate the new
  definition of saturation vapor pressure (see previous bullet).

- The saturation adjustment scheme for runs with the Goddard scheme was a
  big mess.  It's better now.

- Made modifications to the Goddard ice microphysics code following
  Potter (1991, "Improvements to a Commonly Used Cloud Microphysical Bulk
  Parameterization", JAM, 30, 1040-1042).

- Made a few minor changes in the fallout code to help enforce mass 
  conservation.

- Modified the subgrid turbulence code so that only perturbation winds
  contibute to shear production.

- Fixed a minor bug in the calculation of moist Brunt-Vaisala frequency
  in the turbulence code.  Previously, there was a problem with the 
  calculation at the surface and upper boundaries.

- Added some code to ensure that the calculation of density potential
  temperature did not use negative water fields.

- Fixed a bug in the "total moisture" stat involving accumulated surface
  precipitation.
