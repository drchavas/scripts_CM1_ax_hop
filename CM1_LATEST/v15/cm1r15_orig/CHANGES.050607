CM1 version 1 release 9:  7 June 2005.

Summary of changes.


-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

 - None.  This is a bug fix release.


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

Stuff not related to MPI:

 - Fixed some errors with the isnd = 10 option (base)

 - Fixed a loop index bug in TC initialization code.  Thanks to Justin
   Arnott (PSU) for finding this.  (init3d)

 - Fixed a minor bug with 6th-order advection near open boundary conditions.
   (adv6u and adv6v)

 - Set the turbulence coefficients back to the "traditional" values
   (Ck = 0.10, Pr = 3.00, except for Ce, which now maxes out at 
   pi*pi*Ck = 0.987).  (turbtke)

 - Set stability (Nm^2) check to be 1.0e-6 instead of zero.  Prevents
   possible divide by zero on some machines.  (turbtke)

 - Changed moist stability calculation to become active only when both
   neighboring points are saturated.  (calcnm)

 - Changed turbulence code to diffuse total u and v.  (Previous code
   diffused the perturbations values.)  (solve)

 - Modified the roflux = 1 option to account for stretched grids.
   (restrict_openbc_we and restrict_openbc_sn)

 - Fixed a boundary condition issue when a rigid wall boundary condition
   was used.  (sound and sounde)



MPI-specific stuff:

 - Fixed a number of minor bugs with the initialization of terrain in
   MPI mode.  (param, base, and added some new subroutines in comm.F
   and bc.F)

 - Code now supports pdscheme = 1 with MPI (pdefx, pdefy)

 - Code now properly initializes all stat output to be zero before
   performing MPI_SUM operations (statpack, and multiple subroutines in
   misclibs.F)

 - Fixed bug with max cloud top calculation on some machines (cloud)

 - Fixed bug with file sizes.  Code now properly reinitializes all files
   sizes to be zero when first opened.  (writeout)

 - Fixed bug with interpolated output with terrain option.  Code now
   properly opens and closes files.  (writeout)

 - Fixed a lower-boundary-condition bug with tke and terrain. (turbs)

 - Made some minor mods to boundary conditions when using MPI.
   (multiple subroutines in bc.F)

 - Fixed a couple of errors in getting passive tracer support with MPI.
   (solve, integq, and soundarr.incl)
