CM1 version 1 release 12:  12 August 2008.

Summary of changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

 - Added ability to run an axisymmetric version of the model (axisymm=1).
   See README.axisymm for more information.

 - Added ability to include dissipative heating (idiss=1).  This improves
   energy conservation in the model.

 - Added the Morrison et al (2005, JAS, pg 1665) double-moment microphysics
   scheme (ptype=5).

 - Added the ability to use different turbulence coefficients for the 
   horizontal and vertical directions.  For tconfig=1, the same 
   coefficients are used;  this was the only option previously, and it is
   appropriate if dx and dy are approximately the same as dz.  For tconfig=2
   (new), different coefficients are retrieved and used appropriately; 
   this is necessary if dx and/or dy are much larger than dz. 

 - Added the ability to integrate potential temperature on the small time 
   step (thsmall=0,1);  when thsmall=1, the stability for gravity wave 
   propagation is set by the small time step instead of the large time 
   step (see Skamarock and Klemp, 1992, MWR, pg 2119).  See
   README.namelist for more information.

 - Added namelist variables to specify lower/upper boundary conditions 
   for vertical diffusion.  This includes subgrid turbulence as well as 
   artificial diffusion.  The variables are called bcturbu for winds 
   and bcturbs for scalars.  See README.namelist for more information. 

 - Added ability to use rigid wall lateral boundary conditions (bc = 3)
   when running the anelastic/incompressible solvers (psolver = 4 and 5).

 - Added support for netcdf output.  Use output_format = 2 in
   namelist.output file.  Thanks to Dan Kirshbaum (U. Reading) for 
   providing this code.

 - Added support for hdf output.  Use output_format = 3 or 4 in 
   namelist.output.  See comments at top of writeout_hdf.F for
   an explanation of the difference between format 3 and 4.  Thanks to 
   Leigh Orf (Central Michigan University) for providing this code. 

 - Added support for g95 compiler (see Makefile).

 - Added to the cm1 website several useful GrADS scripts.  See
   http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/grads/

 - Added to the cm1 website several sample scripts for running cm1 on NCAR's 
   supercomputers.  See http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/scripts/

 - Added to the cm1 website several soundings for idealized simulations.
   See http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/soundings/

 - Added to the cm1 website everal pre-configured namelist.input files for 
   idealized simulations.  Currently, there are namelists for a supercell 
   simulation, a squall line simulation, and an axisymmetric hurricane 
   simulation.  See http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/namelists/

 - Added the ability to include the base-state fields in the output file.
   Use output_basestate=1.

 - Added the ability to write one output file per output time 
   (output_filetype=2).  See README.namelist for more information.

 - Merged all namelists into a single file:  namelist.input
   (removed namelist.output and namelist.stats)

 - Added 10 flex variables (var1,var2,var3 ... var10) in the namelist.input
   file.  Users can use these variables to easily change parameters in the 
   model without re-compiling the code.  See README.namelist for more 
   details.

 - Included several schemes to run the idealized hurricane simulations 
   of Rotunno and Emanuel (1987, JAS, p. 542), including:
     - a Smagorinsky-type turbulence scheme for axisymmetric models (iturb=3)
       (user must set l_h and l_v in namelist.input)
     - a simple microphysics parameterization (ptype=6)
       (user must set v_t in namelist.input)
     - a simple relaxation term to mimic atmospheric radiation (rterm=1)
     - ability to include Rayleigh damping near lateral boundaries (hrdamp=1)
     - a tropical cyclone initialization method (that works correctly
       for distributed memory (MPI) simulations) (iinit=7)
     - (Note: a namelist.input file for RE87-type simulations is available
        on the CM1 website.  See:  
        http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/namelists/ )

 - Added ability to include horizontal grid stretching near one boundary
   only (stretch_x=2 and stretch_y=2).

 - Added a general piece of code to include random perturbations into 
   initial conditions, which works properly for distributed memory (MPI)
   runs (irandp=1).

 - Added an analytic base state (isnd=11) that specifies constant 
   saturated equivalent potential temperature (theta_e).  The formulation 
   of theta_e can be either pseudoadiabatic or reversible (see code in 
   base.F).

 - Added ability to specify a constant horizontal wind as an initial
   base state (iwnd=6).

 - Added option to apply Coriolis acceleration to perturbation winds only
   (pertcor=1).

 - Added option to calculate surface fluxes using perturbation winds only
   (pertflx=1).

 - Added ability to change format of text printout of model integration
   time;  user can now select seconds, minutes, hours, or days. 

 - Added a limiter on subgrid turbulence coefficients to ensure that 
   numerical stability is not exceeded.  This is usually not activated 
   unless grid spacing is very large (dx,dy > 10 km,  dz > 1 km).

 - Added ability to include vertical transport of energy associated with 
   hydro-meteor sedimentation (efall=1).  This improves energy 
   conservation in the model.


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

 - Made some modifications to the elliptic pressure solver to increase 
   accuracy and efficiency when using the anelastic/incompressible option.
   (init3d.F, poiss.F) 

 - Changed the location of tke and turbulence coefficients from the 
   scalar point to the w point.  This improves vertical transport near 
   boundaries and sharp inversions.  (multiple files)

 - Made several bug fixes in the Thompson microphysics code.  The scheme
   is now fully supported in MPI mode.  (thompson.F)

 - Changed the Makefile conventions so that the extension ".f90" is used
   instead of ".f".   This fixes an issue when using case-insensitive
   operating systems (e.g., certain macs).  (Makefile)

 - Made a minor modification to ensure that more than 1,000 processors 
   can be used without incident.  (param.F)

 - Modified the stats output so that actual grid point values are included
   with the max/min stats for MPI runs.  (maxmin.F, misclibs.F)

 - Fixed a bug for mdiff=1 with scalars.  (diff6.F)

 - Modified positive-definite scheme (pdscheme=1) to improve accuracy
   and efficiency.  (adv6.F)

 - Fixed some minor bugs in ptype=4 (GSR version of LFO scheme).  Code
   now parallelizes perfectly.  (goddard.F, solve.F)

 - Fixed a minor bug with OpenMP implementation of surface fluxes.
   (sfcphys.F)

 - Fixed a problem with performance associated with underflows and/or 
   overflows in the ppi array.  Usually only a problem in early parts
   of simulations.  (integ.F, sound.F, sounde.F)

 - Made several modifications and improvements to the subgrid turbulence
   schemes (iturb=1,2), mostly with regards to specification of subgrid 
   turbulence near the surface.
