CM1 version 1 release 11:  23 October 2006.

Summary of changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

 - The model now uses "make" (or "gmake"), which replaces the old "compile"
   script.  See "README.compile" for more information.  (No effect on 
   results.)

 - A significant coding change was made to accomodate new microphysics 
   schemes.  The old hard-wired arrays (e.g., qc, qr, qg, etc) have been 
   replaced with general arrays (qa, q3d, and qten).  See the document
   "new_microphysics.pdf" at http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1 for 
   more information.  (No effect on results.)

 - Two new microphysics schemes have been added:  ptype = 3 is the 
   Thompson microphysics scheme;  and ptype = 4 is the Gilmore/Straka/
   Rasmussen (GSR) version of the LFO scheme.  (See README.parallel
   for notes about using these schemes with OpenMP and/or MPI.)
   (Note:  ptype=4 does not work with terrain, at the moment)

 - The model now uses dynamic memory allocation for ALL arrays.  Users
   no longer need to recompile to change domain size.  The variables 
   nx, ny, nz, nodex, and nodey have been moved to namelist.input.  Users
   do not have to change anything in "input.incl" anymore.  (No effect 
   on results.)

 - Added more documentation in the main model directory:
      README.compile - How to compile cm1
      README.restart - How to restart cm1
      README.output - Documentation for the namelist.output file
      README.2D - Comments and suggestions for two-dimensional simulations
      README.parcel - Documentation for parcels within cm1 simulations
      README.parallel - Comments and suggestions for parallel processing

 - Changed the anelastic solver to use the Bannon (1996) equations.
   Previously, the code used something very similar to the Durran (1989)
   "psuedo-incompressible" equations.  Note, however, that when using 
   a compressible solver, and when ibalance=2, then the Durran-like
   equations are used to define the initial pressure field.
   (poiss.F, anelp.F)

 - Changed the isnd=7 code to accept WRF Model and Klemp-Wilhelmson Model
   format external sounding file (named 'input_sounding').  When isnd=7
   is chosen, the iwnd value is now ignored;  wind profile is obtained 
   from the sounding.  See inline comments in the isnd=7 section of 
   base.F for more info.

 - Added an option, "timestats = 2", which outputs timing results for
   every time step, in addition to the overall timing statistics that 
   are printed at the end of each simulation.  (No effect on results.)

 - Added a new variable to namelist.input called "ifall", which changes 
   the algorithm for hydrometeor sedimentation (i.e., fallout).  (This
   option was available in older versions of the model, but was buried 
   inside the code, and the user had to recompile to change the algorithm.)
   See README.namelist for more information.  (No effect on results if 
   ifall = 3 is chosen.)

 - Added a new variable ... prclfrq ... that specifies the frequency to 
   output parcel data (if iprcl=1).

 - Added a new variable in namelist.output ... output_basename ... that 
   allows the user to specify a base filename for output.  Default name 
   is 'cm1out'.  (Note to ARPS users:  this is similar in concept to 
   "runname").

 - To prepare for future development, a variable has been added to 
   namelist.output ... output_format ... that allows the user to choose
   the format of the output files.  At the moment, only the GrADS-format
   output is officially supported.


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

 - Increased the default value of time off-centering for the vertically 
   implicit acoustic solver (alph:  was 0.55, now is 0.60).  This helps 
   solve a problem with numerical stability when dx >> dz.  Also, this
   variable has been moved into namelist.input, so users can change the
   value without needing to recompile the code.  (sound.F) 

 - Changed the default value for open-radiative boundary condition
   (from irbc=1 to irbc=4).  This usually helps with pressure-drift
   problems.  If pressure drift still happens, users can try 
   roflux=1.  (namelist.input)

 - Removed the conserved-variable saturated mixing scheme (smix=1).
   This option may be re-evaluated in the future.

 - Removed isnd=6 option (sounding for tropical cyclone initialization).
   The option isnd=7 should be used for this sounding, although I haven't
   gotten around to creating a 'input_sounding' file yet.  (base.F)

 - Fixed a very minor bug with the total moisture diagnostic output variable 
   for MPI runs.  No effect on results.  (misclibs.F)

 - Made a minor change to ensure that output files (stats.dat and 
   cm1out_*.dat) and written more often.  This ensures that these files 
   are retained in the event of a model crash on some machines.  No effect 
   on results.  (writeout.F, statpack.F)

 - Added time splitting to all sedimentation schemes, when needed (which is 
   determined in the code, during model run-time).  This helps fix a 
   problem when fall velocities are large and/or vertical grid spacing is 
   small.  Little change on results for most simulations.  (kessler.F)

 - Made a bunch of changes to the parcel driver to increase efficiency on 
   distributed memory systems.  This helps trmendously when a very large 
   number of parcels are used.  No effect on results.  (parcel.F)

 - Fixed a bug associated with boundary conditions in the parcel driver.
   For single-processor runs, this only affects parcels that approach a 
   lateral boundary.  For multiple-processor runs, this has a small effect,
   but is needed to ensure perfect parallelization.  (parcel.F)

 - Modified the code to have two surface arrays for rn and sws when the 
   user chooses imove=1; both are also included in the output files. 
   One is the accumulated field at model grid points, the other 
   is the accumulated field assuming a translating lower surface.
   Previously, if the user chose imove=1, only the translating lower 
   surface result was sent to the output file.  No effect on results.
   (solve.F, kessler.F, writeout.F)

 - Unified the constants between the varying microphysics schemes, as 
   well as those seen by the model's solver.  In general, I chose the 
   value from the Gilmore et al. (2004) supplement.  When a variable 
   was constant in one scheme but temperature-dependent in another, 
   I used the constant value at the reference temperature (to = 273.16 K).
   (Thompson scheme not included, for the moment.)
   (constants.incl, kessler.F, goddard.F, lfoice.F, lfoice.incl)

 - For the Goddard-LFO scheme, I set the autoconversion of qc to qr back 
   on as the default value (dunno why it was off by default before), but 
   increased the autoconversion threshold from 1 g/kg to 2 g/kg.
   (goddard.F, namelist.input)

 - Modified the Goddard code so that the density of snow was set back to 
   normal values for calculations of accretion rates between snow-rain and 
   snow-graupel.  This bug was introduced way back in cm1r5 when the 
   Potter (1991, JAM) fall velocity modification was introduced.  (goddard.F)

 - Added a piece of code at the end of subroutine "base" to make sure that 
   the base-state is not statically unstable.  (base.F)

 - Fixed a minor bug with the sfcdrag scheme:  multiplication by rho0 was 
   not accounting for the grid staggering.  No effect on results if terrain
   is not used, very small effect on results otherwise.  (sfcphys.F)

 - Fixed a bug with the sfcflux scheme:  need to multiple flux array by 
   rho0 (to be dimensionally correct).  Small-to-no change on results if 
   base-state density at surface is near 1 kg/m^3 (which is probably true 
   for most simulations).  (turbtke.F)
