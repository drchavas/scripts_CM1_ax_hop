CM1 version 1 release 3:  16 March 2003.

Summary of changes.


-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

- Added option to select machine type in compile script, with default
  compiler flags and options.  Makes code easier to move between
  machines.

- Modified timer to be platform-independent.  User no longer needs to
  modify the "mytime" subroutine.

- Added option to integrate passive fluid tracers (iptra=1).

- Added option to output maximum integrated surface wind speed
  (output_sws=1).

- Added option to output total upward and downward mass flux
  (stat_tmf).

- Surface output fields (i.e., accumulated rain and sws) are translated 
  when the domain is moving (i.e, when imove=1).



-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications.

- Modified advection, turbulence, and divergence damper codes to include
  base-state density in vertical derivatives.  This isolates the anelastic
  divergence term (i.e., continuity equation), as opposed to the previous
  formulation, which isolated the incompressible continuity equation.
  This results in a small improvement in mass conservation.

- Modified Goddard microphysics scheme to run on IBM SP with OpenMP.
  No change in results.

- Fixed bug with saturation adjustment for ice microphysics.

- Fixed minor bug with liquid water component of buoyancy term.
  (Was previously computing liquid component FIT, rather than Runge-Kutta
  in time.)

- Modified vertical component of sixth order diffusion code.

- Added artificial diffusion of TKE.  (when idiff=1)

- Modified calcnm subroutine to accomodate ice microphysics.  At temperatures
  below 253 K, Brunt-Vaisala frequency is computed with respect to ice.
