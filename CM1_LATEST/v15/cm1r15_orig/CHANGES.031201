CM1 version 1 release 7:  1 December 2003.

Summary of changes.


-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

- Artificial diffusion scheme now has monotonic option (mdiff = 1).
  See Xue, 2000, MWR, 2853-2864 for more details.

- Saturated turbulent mixing scheme is now officially included (smix = 1).
  With this scheme, the conserved variables ice-liquid water potential
  temperature (theta-il) and total water mixing ratio (qt) are mixed
  instead of dry potential temperature and the individiual water mixing
  ratios. Currently, it is formulated for liquid-water conditions only
  (i.e., ptype = 1 only).

- Added a new method for integrating the new equation set (neweqts = 2).
  With this option, a provisional saturation adjustment step is performed
  on the first RK predictor step.  This scheme is preferred over the old
  (i.e., over neweqts = 1).

- Modified Smagorinsky turbulence closure to have a stability-dependent
  length-scale, dissipation coefficient, and Prandtl number.  The old
  option is still available by setting "config = 1" in subrouting 
  "turbsmag".


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

- Modified code to store and integrate perturbation potential temperature
  (as opposed to total potential temperature).  Now, tha and th3d arrays
  hold perturbation potential temperature.  Total theta is now (th0+tha)
  or (th0+th3d).

- Anelastic pressure field at initial time (ibalance = 2) is now supported
  in parallel (both OpenMP and MPI).

- Made a buttload of performance enhancements (i.e., it go faster now).

- Changed a bunch of other minor things too.
