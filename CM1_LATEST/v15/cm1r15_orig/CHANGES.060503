CM1 version 1 release 10:  3 May 2006.

Summary of changes.


-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

 - Added ability to use different order for the horizontal and vertical
   advection.  In namelist.input, the flag "advorder" has been replaced
   with two new flags:  "hadvorder" and "vadvorder". 

 - Added a new option, "iorigin", which specifies the location of the
   origin in horizontal space.  For iorigin = 1, the origin is at the 
   bottom-left corner of the domain;  this is the original formulation.
   For iorigin = 2, the origin is at the center of the domain;  this is
   a new option, which is recommended for simulations that require
   perfect symmetry about the center of the domain.

 - Added the ability to use the incompressible equations:  psolver = 5.

 - Added the ability to run with double precision (CompileType = 11 and 12).
   For now, this only works on Linux machines using the Portland Group 
   compiler (and without MPI).  


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

 - Fixed a bug in advection subroutines for simulations with terrain,
   as well as a similar bug in the subgrid turbulence code with terrain
   only.  Probably a small effect.
   (Thanks to Marcello Miglietta and Richard Rotunno for forcing me
    to find these.)
   (adv5, adv6, turbw)

 - Fixed a problem that would cause nasty things to happen if the user
   had chosen negative values for umove and/or vmove.  No problems in 
   earlier version if umove and vmove were positive or zero.
   (Thanks to Leigh Orf for finding this problem.)
   (movesfc)

 - Fixed a bug with interpolated output (_i files) for simulations using
   terrain and stretched vertical grid.  No problems in earlier versions
   if stretch_z was not used.
   (Thanks to Marcello Miglietta for finding this.)
   (zinterp)

 - Fixed a minor problem that could cause the model to crash if the
   Rayleigh damping layer is specified to be above the model top.  No
   change on results as long as the Rayleigh damper is inside the domain.
   (param)

 - Fixed a small bug with Rayleigh damping of w for simulations with
   terrain.  Dunno if this was a big problem or not, but it's probably
   a small effect.
   (param)

 - Fixed a potential bug if the user requests dns = 1.  In previous versions, 
   this bug was not a problem if the base-state was isentropic.
   (solve)

 - Removed the tropical cyclone initialization code.  (FYI, I am working 
   on an initialization code that would be external to the model itself.
   The TC code will go in there.  If you need this code now, then contact
   George.)
   (init3d)

 - Improved the performance of the anelastic and incompressible solvers
   (psolver = 4,5) by avoiding some unnecessary calculations.
   (solve, integthrk)
