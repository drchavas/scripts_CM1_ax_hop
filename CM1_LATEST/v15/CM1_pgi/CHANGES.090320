CM1 version 1 release 13:  20 March 2009.

Summary of changes.

-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

 - Added a variable to namelist.input, called cecd, that allows the user
   to choose various settings for the surface exchange coefficients for 
   enthalphy (Ce) and momentum (Cd).  See README.namelist for more 
   information. 

 - Added the ability to output reflectivity (dBZ) that is consistent with
   the assumptions/settings in the microphysics scheme.  To enable, user
   must set output_dbz=1 in namelist.input.  It is only available for the
   Goddard-LFO, Thompson, and Morrison microphysics schemes (ptype=2,3,5
   respectively). 

 - Replaced the Thompson microphysics scheme with a new version.  The
   primary change for the new version is the use of double-moment rain 
   (in addition to double-moment ice crystals, as before;  all other 
   categories of water are still single-moment).

 - Added a new variable (xhd) to namelist.input so user can set the width 
   of the Rayleigh damper near horizontal boundaries (for hrdamp=1).  See 
   README.namelist for more information.


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

 - Fixed a potentially serious problem when using isnd = 7.  This only
   affects simulations in which base-state winds were not equal to zero.
   Thanks to Dan Kirshbaum (U. Reading) and Leigh Orf (Central Michigan U.)
   for helping identify and debug this problem.  (base.F)

 - Generalized the code that sets the Rayleigh damper near horizontal
   boundaries (hrdamp=1).  The code should now work properly for 3d
   simulations, rectangular domains, 3d MPI, etc.   Thanks to David 
   Ryglicki (Florida State U.) for helping identify the problem and 
   helping test new versions of this code.  (param.F)

 - Fixed the units on precipitation when using the Thompson microphysics
   scheme.  (Previous version of cm1 was outputting precip in mm, not 
   cm as advertised.)  Thanks to Leigh Orf (Central Michigan U.) for 
   identifying this problem.  (thompson.F)

 - Updated the Morrison double-moment microphysics scheme (ptype = 5).
   Thanks to Hugh Morrison (NCAR) for providing this code.  (morrison.F)

 - The ihail switch (see README.namelist) now works with the Morrison 
   microphysics scheme.  (morrison.F, param.F)

 - Fixed a bug in the autoconversion calculation of the GSR-LFO scheme 
   (ptype=4).  Thanks to Ted Mansell and Matt Gilmore.  (lfoice.F)

 - Fixed a minor bug with the positive-definite moisture scheme.  Thanks 
   to Dan Kirshbaum (U. Reading) for finding this problem.  (adv6.F)

 - Made another minor change to positive-definite moisture advection to 
   increase performance.  Very small affect on results.  (integ.F)

 - Made some performance enhancements to pressure solver.  No change on
   results.  (sound.F, sounde.F, soundns.F)

 - Fixed a minor bug with passive tracer output for dry simulations
   (imoist=0 only).  (statpack.F)

 - Fixed some minor bugs associated with mass stats for axisymmetric 
   model runs.  (No change on results ... only change on stats output.)
   (solve.F, kessler.F, sfcphys.F)

 - Fixed an error with the calculation of total condensation when 
   neweqts=2.  (No change on results ... only change on stats output.)
   (solve.F)

 - Modified the idealized tropical cyclone initialization to keep the 
   relative humidity constant across the vortex.  (init3d.F)

 - Code now outputs Cd and Ce (surface exchange coefficients for momentum
   and enthalpy, respectively) when output_sfcflx = 1.  (several files)

 - Fixed a problem with netcdf output of zh array when using terrain.  
   Thanks to Dan Kirshbaum (U. Reading) for finding this.  (writeout_nc.F)

 - Fixed a minor bug with netcdf output of qvpert.  Thanks to Glen Romine
   (U. Illinois) for finding this bug.  (writeout_nc.F)

 - Made several improvements to the skew-T script (plotskew.gs) for GrADS users 
   (See http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/people/bryan/cm1/grads/), including:
     - Corrected the units of wind speed (it's now in knots)
     - Don't allow dewpoint depression to exceed 75 C.  For some reason,
       this improves the CAPE calculation in very dry environments.
     - Made some other minor changes to improve file handling.
