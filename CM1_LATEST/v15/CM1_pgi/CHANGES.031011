CM1 version 1 release 6:  11 October 2003.

Summary of changes.


-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

- Added the ability to advect scalars (potential temperature, moisture,
and TKE) with a fifth-order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO)
scheme (advweno=1).

- Added the ability to run the model in Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)
mode (dns=1).  There are six new parameters in namelist.input (in the
param7 section) that need to be set for dns runs.  See README.namelist
for more information.

- Added a new stat field:  stat_qsrc.  This option accounts for moisture
sources that are not associated with the microphysics scheme, including:
artificial sources due to non-positive-definiteness of numerics;  and,
sources/sinks of moisture through open boundary conditions.

- Added option pdscheme=1, a nearly mass-conserving scheme that ensures
positive-definiteness of moisture variables due to advection.

- Added dry, constant d-theta/dz sounding (isnd=8).

- Added option to apply artificial diffusion to winds only (idiff=2).
