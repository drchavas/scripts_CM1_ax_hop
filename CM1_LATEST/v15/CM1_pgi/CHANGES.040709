CM1 version 1 release 8:  9 July 2004.

Summary of changes.


-------------------------------------------------------------
1.  New options/features.

- Added horizontal grid stretching.  See README.stretch for more information.

- Added terrain.  There is a variable, "terrain_flag", in "input.incl" that
  must be set before compliling.  The user can set the terrain profile in
  "param.F".

- Added the option to use the anelastic equation set.  Richard James (PSU)
  deserves most of the credit for making this happen.  This option currently
  has three major limitations:  1) it cannot be used with terrain;  2) it
  can only be used with periodic boundary conditions;  and 3) it cannot be
  used with distributed memory (i.e., with MPI).  It can only be parallelized
  with shared memory, OpenMP right now.

- The variables "implsound" and "kwss" have been removed, and replaced with
  the variable "psolver", which has four options:

            1) truly compressible
            2) Klemp-Wilhelmson time-splitting, fully explicit
            3) Klemp-Wilhelmson time-splitting, vertically implicit
            4) anelastic

- Added the ability to use an arbitrary number of passive fluid tracers,
  using the variable "npt" in "namelist.input".

- Added the ability to include passive parcels during the model integration.
  See variables "iprcl" and "nparcels" in "namelist.input".

- Added the option to use WENO advection on only the final Runge-Kutta
  step (advweno=2).  This can considerably decrease run times, but is
  still considered experimental.

- Added a new variable in "namelist.output" called "output_path".  This is
  the path where you would like to place all of the output files (i.e.,
  cm1out*.dat, stats.dat, pdata.dat, restart files).

- Added a new variable in "namelist.input" called iautoc.  This allows the
  user to choose whether or not to include autoconversion of qc to qr when
  using the ice microphysics scheme.

- Added a new variable in "namelist.input" call roflux.  For roflux=1, the
  total outward mass flux at open boundary conditions is not allowed to 
  exceed total inward mass flux.  This is a requirement for the anelastic 
  solver.  For the compressible solvers, this scheme helps prevent runaway 
  outward mass flux that can cause domain-total mass loss and pressure falls.


-------------------------------------------------------------
1b.  Notes about the code.

Previous users should note the following changes concerning the code:

- The integer arrays "iid" and "jid" have been replaced by the real
  arrays "xh" and "yh".

- The base state arrays are now three-dimensional (x-y-z), instead of just
  one-dimensional (z).  (This change was necessary to accomodate terrain.)
  However, please keep in mind that the base state is still assumed to be
  horizontally homogeneous.


-------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Changes, fixes, modifications, etc.

- Fixed the vertical advection bug with vertical grid stretching. (The bug
  did not affect runs with r7 that had constant vertical grid spacing.)

- The divergence damper for compressible simulations has been modified.
  It is now similar to the one used in MM5 and WRF.

- Added MPI support for truly compressible solver.

- Modified the horizontal advection formulation near open boundary conditions.
  The new code minimizes the introduction of noise at inflow boundaries.

- Updated and debugged the tropical cyclone initialization option (iinit=6).
